## Section 1: Getting Started With Serverless Computing on AWS

### What is Serverless? (A 30,000 ft. View)

- Serverless computing is the new trend in cloud computing that attempts to solve the challengs of applications that need to be fast, responsive, and scalable with almost no downtime.
- Serverless computing will help you build the next generation of systems that can handle demanding workloads and scale indefinitely without having to provision or manage any servers.

Traditional architecture:

- you got to create and setup servers,
- install operating systems,
- install and setupdatabases,
- manage software patches and hardware updates,
- manage capacity and scaling, ManageHigh-availability through load-balancing and so on

This server infrastructure and the computing power has its own costs, which are often substantial.

Serverless architecture:

- Serverless Architecture, all these mundane tasks of managing the underlying infrastructure are abstracted away from us.

 Serverless Computing still uses servers, but you no longer have to worry about managing them or worry about the uptime or availability or anything that has to do with the infrastructure part.

Advantages of Serverless vs. Traditional

- You kind of get to be more productive
- You can completely focus on writing your code without having to worry about the underlying support system
- So you simply upload your code to the cloud provider and it can be run on-demand as and when needed.
